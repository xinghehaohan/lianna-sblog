Hey,I am Lianna, thanks for landing on this page and checking out a more extensive version of my humble-brag page ðŸ˜„

## Why

This corner of the internet helps me clarify and improve my own thinking. Its a mechanism to cope with my chaotic brain that constantly comes up with thoughts or comprehensions of the world concepts but sometimes has conflicts or struggles to structure and organize them.

I believe writing is a superpower that most people are yet to discover, because its mainly a path to understanding yourself and sense-making of a rapidly changing world we live in.
